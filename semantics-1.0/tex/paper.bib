@inproceedings{findel,
	Abstract = {Blockchain-based smart contracts are considered a promising technology for handling financial agreements securely. In order to realize this vision, we need a formal language to unambiguously describe contract clauses. We introduce Findel -- a purely declarative financial domain-specific language (DSL) well suited for implementation in blockchain networks. We implement an Ethereum smart contract that acts as a marketplace for Findel contracts and measure the cost of its operation. We analyze challenges in modeling financial agreements in decentralized networks and outline directions for future work (See the author's post-print at                     https://orbilu.uni.lu/handle/10993/30975                                       and the related source code at                     https://github.com/cryptolu/findel                                      ).},
